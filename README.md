# FacialRecognition
This project is a Facial Recognition Attendance System that uses computer vision and machine learning to automate attendance tracking. It detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using a webcam, matches them against a trained dataset, and records the attendance with a timestamp.

The system can be effectively used in educational institutions or corporate environments to enhance accuracy and reduce manual workload in attendance management.
